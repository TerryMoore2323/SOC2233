## Topic for Project

In my final project, I plan to answer the research question "What factors contribute to the highest Halloween Candy Ranking?" and to answer the question, I plan to use the `candy_rankings` dataset from fivethirtyeight.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
theme_set(theme_light())
candy_rankings <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv")
glimpse(candy_rankings)
```

```{r}
glimpse(candy_rankings)
```
