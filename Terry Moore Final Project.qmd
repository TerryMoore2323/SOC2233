## Introduction

In my final project, I plan to answer the research question "What factors contribute to the highest Halloween Candy Ranking?" and to answer the question, I plan to use the \`candy_rankings\` dataset from fivethirtyeight. This data was obtained in 2017 by generating a random matchup between two candies. While the identities of the participants were anonymous (meaning we don't know their age or gender), we do know that 8,371 unique IP addresses voted in 269,000 samples.

The variables presented in this dataset that I will be analyzing are:\
\
\* chocolate: candy contains chocolate\
\* fruity: candy is fruit-flavored\
\* caramel: contains caramel\
\* peanutalmondy: contains peanuts, peanut butter or almonds\
\* nougat: contains nougat\
\* crispedricewafer: contains crisped rice, wafers or cookie\
\* hard: whether or not it's hard candy\
\* bar: whether or not it's a candy bar\
\* pluribus: multiple candies come in the package\
\* sugarpercent: percentile of sugar compared to the data.\
\* pricepercent: unit price percentile compared to the data.\
\* winpercent: overall win percentage according to 269,000 matchups

##  Exploratory Data Analysis

Top 30 candies

```{r}
choc_vs_fruity<-candy_rankings%>%
  mutate(flavor_profile = if_else(chocolate == 1 & fruity == 1, "both",
                          if_else(chocolate == 1, "chocolate",
                          if_else(fruity == 1, "fruity", "other"))))
ggplot(choc_vs_fruity, aes(x = reorder(competitorname, winpercent), y = winpercent, fill = flavor_profile)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.7) +
scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE))+
  labs(title = "Win Percent by Candy Type", x = "Candy Type", y = "Win Percent", fill = "Flavor Profile")+
  coord_flip()
```

From first glance, it appears that many of the top ranked candies fall under the chocolate category, but also have another component like peanut butter, caramel, nougat, or crisp/wafer. This observation will inform the kinds of tests I want to perform later on to determine which factors make for the most popular Halloween candy.

```{r}
M = cor(candy_rankings[,2:13])
corrplot(M, order = 'hclust', addrect = 2)
```

I decided to add boxes to the correlation matrix highlight the variables with positive correlation. Based on my observation, the variable chocolate has a stronger positive correlation winpercent than fruity has with winpercent, which leads me to believe that chocolate might be the more influential factor in candy popularity. Overall, chocolate is positively correlated with several other candy ingredients, such as crispedricewafer, caramel, nougat, and peanutalmondy. I will explore whether certain combinations of these ingredients with chocolate affect the overall winpercent.\
On the other hand, fruity is negatively correlated with winpercent and has an even stronger negative correlation with chocolate. I interpret this as fruity and chocolate candies typically being more independent of each other, which adds another element to the candy debate: chocolate vs. fruity.

```{r}
choc_vs_fruity<-candy_rankings%>%
  mutate(flavor_profile = if_else(chocolate == 1 & fruity == 1, "both",
                          if_else(chocolate == 1, "chocolate",
                          if_else(fruity == 1, "fruity", "neither"))))

choc_vs_fruity%>%
  filter(flavor_profile!="neither" & flavor_profile!="both")%>%
  group_by(flavor_profile)%>%
  summarise(n=n(), mean_win = mean(winpercent))%>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1, full_width = F)
```

With a quick calculation of the average win percent for each category, we can determine that chocolate wins the debate over fruity candy, with the higher mean win percentage of 61%. Now we can move on to examining the factors that positively correlate with chocolate.\
\\nThe following bar plot visualizes a version of candy_rankings that gathers all of the categorical variables (filtered for chocolate, peanutyalmondy, nougat, crispedricewafer and caramel). I felt it was only important to include these categorical variables, and not fruity, bar or pluribus, because we already determined that chocolate was the stronger contender in the fruity vs. chocolate debate, and we are only looking at flavor components in this analysis. The barplot shows these flavor components as the independent variable, with win percent as the dependent variable.

```{r}
candy_rankings_gathered <- gather(data = candy_rankings, key = components,value = value, chocolate:crispedricewafer)%>%
  filter(value==1 & components!="fruity")
candy_rankings_gathered%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = components, y = winpercent, fill = components)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  labs(title = "Win Percent by Component", x = "Component", y = "Win Percent")+
  coord_flip()
```

When looking at this barplot, I notice that chocolate has the highest winpercent, followed by peanuty almondy and caramel. This will shape our future analysis because we can focus on chocolate and these two positively correlated ingredients as factors in candy popularity.

## Multiple Linear Regression

3.1 Methods

Based on Figure \..., I want to focus only on the peanutyalmondy, caramel and chocolate components because those had the highest winpercent when each component was present in the candy. The following linear model examines the relationship between winpercent (the response variable) and the interaction effects of three categorical variables: chocolate, peanutyalmondy, and caramel.

3.2 Model Results

Modeling sugar vs price

```{r}
choc_model <- lm(winpercent ~ chocolate * peanutyalmondy + chocolate * caramel, candy_rankings[, 2:13])
get_regression_table(choc_model)%>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1, full_width = F)
```

3.3 Interpreting the Regression Table

The model includes interaction effects, such as chocolate:peanutyalmondy and chocolate:caramel. These coefficients represent how the combined presence of two variables influences winpercent. Positive coefficients suggest a positive impact, while negative coefficients suggest a negative impact. The chocolate:peanutyalmondy and chocolate:caramel interaction terms are statistically significant (p-values \< 0.01), indicating that the combined effects of chocolate with peanutyalmondy and caramel are associated with an increase in winpercent.

The regression equation for this linear model is:\
\$\$\\widehat{winpercent} = \\beta_0 + \\beta\_{choc} \* 1\_{choc}(x_2) + \\beta\_{nutty} \* 1\_{nutty}(x_3) + \\beta\_{carm} \* 1\_{carm}(x_4) \\\\ + \\beta\_{choc\*nutty} \* 1\_{choc\*nutty}(x_2\*x_3)+ \\beta\_{choc\*carm} \* 1\_{choc\*carm}(x_2\*x_4)\$\$\
\$\$ = 43.1 + 12.1 \* 1\_{choc}(x_2) - 8.3 \* 1\_{nutty}(x_3) - 7.6 \* 1\_{carm}(x_4) + 19.7 \* 1\_{choc\*nutty}(x_2\*x_3) + 15 \* 1\_{choc\*carm}(x_2\*x_4)\$\$

\* In this equation: choc, nutty, and carm are binary variables indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of each flavor component. Their interaction terms chocolate:peanutyalmondy and chocolate:caramel are each binary component multiplied by each other.\
\* The intercept \$\\beta_0\$ is 43.1, representing the estimated winpercent when all other flavor components are absent in the candy.\
\* The coefficients represent the estimated change in winpercent when each flavor component is present, keeping other variables constant. For example, when chocolate is present, this makes the winpercent increase by an average of 12.1 points.

The resulting equations from this linear regression are:\
\
\* chocolate:    \$\\widehat{winpercent} = 55.2 \* 1\_{choc}(x_2)\$\
\* peanutalmondy:    \$\\widehat{winpercent} = 34.8 \* 1\_{nutty}(x_3)\$\
\* caramel:    \$\\widehat{winpercent} = 35.5\* {choc}\$\
\* chocolate:peanutyalmondy:    \$\\widehat{winpercent} = 62.8 \* 1\_{choc\*nutty}(x_2\*x_3)\$\
\* chocolate:caramel:    \$\\widehat{winpercent} = 58.1 \* 1\_{choc\*carm}(x_2\*x_4)\$

3.4 Inference for Multiple Regression

Since chocolate:peanutyalmondy had the highest coefficient, I want to use this interaction term in my hypothesis test. But first, I want to determine the relationship between chocolate and winpercent.\
The first null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the presence of chocolate and winpercent.\
\
\$\$H_0: \\beta\_{choc} = 0\$\$\
\$\$H_A: \\beta\_{choc} \\neq 0\$\$\
From our regression table, we can see that \$\\beta\_{choc} = 19.7\$, which shows a positive relationship between the interaction of chocolate:peanutalmondy and winpercent.\
\
\* There is a 95% confidence interval of (6.3, 17.9) for the slope of chocolate, meaning we are 95% confident that \$\\beta\_{choc}\$ falls within that interval.\
\* The p-value is less than 0.001 so we can reject the null hypothesis and favor the alternative hypothesis that the slope of chocolate is not 0.

The second null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the interaction of chocolate:peanutalmondy and winpercent.\
\
\$\$H_0: \\beta\_{choc\*nutty} = 0\$\$\
\$\$H_A: \\beta\_{choc\*nutty} \\neq 0\$\$\
From our regression table, we can see that \$\\beta\_{choc\*nutty} = 12.1\$, which shows a positive relationship between the presence of chocolate:almondy and winpercent.\
\
\* There is a 95% confidence interval of (2.5, 36.9) for the slope of chocolate:almondy , meaning we are 95% confident that \$\\beta\_{choc\*nutty}\$ falls within that interval.\
\* The p-value is less than 0.001 so we can reject the null hypothesis and favor the alternative hypothesis that the slope of chocolate:almondy is not 0.\
\
The third null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the interaction of chocolate:caramel and winpercent.\
\
\$\$H_0: \\beta\_{choc\*carm} = 0\$\$\
\$\$H_A: \\beta\_{choc\*carm} \\neq 0\$\$\
From our regression table, we can see that \$\\beta\_{choc\*carm} = 15\$, which shows a positive relationship between the presence of chocolate:caramel and winpercent.\
\
\* There is a 95% confidence interval of (1.4, 28.7) for the slope of chocolate:caramel, meaning we are 95% confident that \$\\beta\_{choc\*carm}\$ falls within that interval.\
\* The p-value is less than 0.001 so we can reject the null hypothesis and favor the alternative hypothesis that the slope of chocolate:caramel is not 0.\
\
\## 4. Discussion

4.1 Conclusion\
\
Overall, the linear regression model suggests that the presence of chocolate has a positive and statistically significant impact on winpercent. Additionally, the interactions between chocolate and peanutyalmondy, as well as chocolate and caramel, have significant positive effects on winpercent. From prior exploratory data analysis, I found that the average win percent for chocolate candy was higher than that of fruity candy, which eliminated fruity from the factors considered for highest impact on ranking. I then focused on what combination of flavor components predicted the most popular candies, beyond just chocolate. The inferences I made from the regression leads me to a more definitive answer: chocolate peanut butter and chocolate caramel are both flavor combinations that greatly impact a candy's popularity during Halloween.\
\
\### 4.2 Limitations\
\
Some limitations to this data were that we could not identify who was voting during the candy matchups, and there were only 85 observations of the data overall. There was no missing data, so this was not a limiting factor. But not knowing the demographic of people who voted loses valuable insights on the data. For example, a young child might have completely different preferences for candy vs someone older because different candies were popular in different decades. Also, the methods of data collection might be more effective if it was surveying a large sample of people on their one singular favorite candy instead of rankings because we don't know if a lot of matchups had one "irrelevant" candy placed against a widely popular one.\
\
\### 4.3 Further Questions\
\
In the future, I would want to possibly change the data collection process to have rankings or a single selection instead of matchups. I might also explore other factors that affect winpercent, rather than just flavor components, such as bar, pluribus, sugarpercent, and pricepercent.\
